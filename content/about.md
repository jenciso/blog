I'm an IT professional with solid background to create infrastructure solutions in diverse industries as Financial Services and Internet Web Services. I'm looking forward to use cutting edge technology and Open Source Software to create resilience services. Always comfortable to use infrastructure as code to manage large  computers farm using many tools like to ansible, puppet and chef. Actually I'm working focused in microservices architecture technology and cloud native solutions.

Thanks for reading me!
